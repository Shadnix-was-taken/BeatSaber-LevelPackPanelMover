# Beat Saber Level Pack Panel Mover

Moves the bottom panel (containing the level packs) of the Beat Saber main menu further down.

Ever got annoyed by accidentally clicking on a level pack while scrolling down in your song list? Then this mod is for you! Repositioning of the panel is currently hard coded, a configurable version is in the works.

*This mod might move the panel into some custom platforms. Adjustments were tested with the base game menu platform.*
